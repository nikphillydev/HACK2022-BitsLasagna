# HACK2022-BitsLasagna

This project aimed to build an remote-controlled Lego car from scratch using an Arduino. Using C++ for embedded motors and servo and Python for bluetooth connectivity, we successfully controlled the car from a laptop. The car has two drive wheels and one servo controlled wheel in the front for turns. After lots of hard work (in 24 hours!), we won 2nd place in the UofA's HackEd Beta hackathon competition.
