# HACK2022-BitsLasagna

This project aimed to build an remote-controlled toy car from scratch using a Lego frame and Arduino circuitry. Using C++ and Python, we successfully managed to control the car from a laptop. The car has two drive wheels and one servo controlled wheel in the front for turns. After lots of hard work (in 24 hours!), we were fortunate enough to win 2nd place in the UofA's HackEd Beta hackathon competition.
